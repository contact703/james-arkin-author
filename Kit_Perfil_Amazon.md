**THE WORLD CALLS HIM A MONSTER. HE CALLS HIMSELF A GHOST.**

For twenty-eight years, Horace Vance was the face of evil. Convicted for a series of brutal crimes that shocked the nation, he spent decades in isolation, known simply as "The Monster."

But Horace remembers nothing. Not the crimes, not the trial, not the man he used to be. His past is a blank void – a ‘White Veil’ that nothing can break through.

**Then, the impossible happens.**

On his deathbed, a renowned scientist confesses to the murders. The verdict is overturned. Horace is exonerated.

Thrust back into a world that still hates him, Horace tries to rebuild a life with the daughter he left behind. But freedom feels like another kind of prison. As he digs into the mystery of his own past to understand who he really was, inconsistencies begin to surface.

Clues that don't fit the narrative of an innocent victim. A strange, intricate tattoo on his arm that he doesn't remember getting.

Driven by a desperate need for the truth, Horace follows a trail of secrets that everyone – from his lawyer to the police – seems determined to keep buried.

**Is Horace a man wronged by the system? Or is his lack of memory the only thing keeping a true nightmare asleep?**
